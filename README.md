# Next.js Project

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React framework for building fast web applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 16.8 or higher): [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm** (depending on your preference for package management)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd your-repo-name


3. Install the required dependencies:

   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

### Running the Development Server

To start the app in development mode, run one of the following commands based on your package manager:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

This will start a local development server.

Once the server is running, open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### Editing the Project

You can start editing the app by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. The page will auto-update as you edit it, thanks to Next.js' hot-reloading feature.

### Available Scripts

- dev Starts the development server.
- build: Builds the app for production.
- start: Starts the production build.
- lint: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
